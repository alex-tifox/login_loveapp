Test use case for user login screen with mocked logic

## Getting Started

For demonstration, there was implemented such requirements:
- Implemented back navigation from Success to Login screen
- Implemented the “show password” functionality as shown in the mockups
- Handled error while authorizing and communicating them to the user
- Informed the user about the process of asynchronous operations - loader is different from the one suggested
- Implemented data validation for text fields - email with the regexp and the simple one for the password
- Implemented animation of the loader and default 'uppear from the bottom' material transition between screens

- Unit tests where added to test auth service
